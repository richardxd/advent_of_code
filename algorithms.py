"""
This file contains a couple of useful algorithms that tend to
come in handy in some Advent of Code problems.
- Depth-First Search on graphs
- Depth-First Search on grids (using my util.Grid class)
- Breadth-First Search on grids
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
Each algorithm includes a test_algorithm function with a simple
test to show how to set up the data structures and use the algorithm.
Running this Python file will run all the tests.
